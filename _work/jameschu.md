# Jumping into the Web
Creating a front-end site from nothing.

----------

## The Project

Being greatly passionate about both design and code, I wanted to create a personal site that is able to solidify myself as both a capable front-end designer and developer.

A key point of emphasis is to focus on speed and responsiveness, also to explore various web development technologies and methods of approach.

## Design



## Development

To start, I needed to figure out my tech stack to be used for development. And as my research continued, it became clear to me that this was far too deep down a rabbit hole for me to explore at this time. So to keep it simple, I was prepared to use PHP in combination with HTML to do some basic templates. However, I stumbled upon the world that is, static site generators, and specifically the gem, Jekyll. Primarily convinced by a screencast Chris Coyer at CSS-Tricks showcased of his workflow, by pairing it up with a task runner like Grunt. And the rest is history.
