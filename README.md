The site uses a number of open source projects to function properly:

* [Jeykll] - Ruby based static site generator
* [Gulp] - streaming build system
* [NodeJS] - event driven I/O runtime
* [Zurb Foundation] - used for it's responsive grid and SASS mixins
* [Sanitize CSS] - best practice browser CSS normalization
* [Isotope] - JS based layout and filtering library
* [SASS] - extension for CSS
* [Liquid] - Ruby based templating language used with Jeykll
